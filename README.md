**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** Due to the introduction of the new Live Preview feature, this plugin needed to be almost entirely rewritten. Currently the plugin only displays the only the word and character count with selecting text features. ALL other features have been scrapped and will be ported in future updates. **DO NOT UPDATE** If you want to use the legacy editor since their is no backwards compatibility yet (I know I'm lazy but I wanted to release the fix, its been too long).

This plugin is the same as the built-in **Word Count** plugin, except when you select text, it will count the selected word instead of the whole document. I recommend turning off the built-in **Word Count** because this plugin is designed to replace that. This plugin also has the ability to store statistics about your vault.
